# Security Policy

## Overview
ArchIntel is designed to be local-first. By default:
- No source code leaves your machine.
- No network calls are made.
- Logs never include source code content.

Reports are written to `./.archtool/reports` and are intended to be safe, high-level summaries.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please report security issues privately by emailing **security@example.com**. Include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Affected versions (if known)

We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.
